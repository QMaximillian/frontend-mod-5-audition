# Audition

An app focused on giving actors a central location to manage important information related to their auditions. This app uses a React frontend with a matching [Ruby on Rails backend](https://github.com/QMaximillian/backend-mod-5-audition). While V1 was more of a proof of concept, V2 aims to shore up some holes with more useful technologies including:

- ActiveStorage and S3 functionality for handling Actor's resumes as PDF's
- More Effective Time Handling on the Frontend and Backend
- User Authentication
- Custom CSS w/ Grid
